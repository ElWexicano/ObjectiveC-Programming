ObjectiveC-Programming
======================

This repository contains examples that I completed when reading the _Objective-C Programming The Big Nerd Ranch Guide_.

The folder __AGoodStart__ represents the Part 1 of the book.

The folder __Turkey__ represents _Chapter 3 Variables and Types_ in the book.

The folder __TwoFloats__ contains the challenge for _Chapter 3 Variables and Types_ in the book.

The folder __ClassCertificates__ represents _Chapter 5 Functions_ in the book.

The folder __BeerSong__ represents _Chapter 5 Functions_ in the book.

The folder __Degrees__ represents _Chapter 5 Functions_ in the book.

The folder __Triangle__ contains the challenge _Chapter 5 Functions_ in the book.

I will update the README to match the correct chapters as soon as I get the time. I'm very lazy about this.
