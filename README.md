This repository contains examples that I completed when reading the _Objective-C Programming The Big Nerd Ranch Guide_.

The folder __AGoodStart__ represents the Part 1 of the book.

The folder __Turkey__ represents _Chapter 3 Variables and Types_ in the book.

The folder __TwoFloats__ contains the challenge for _Chapter 3 Variables and Types_ in the book.
